# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Overview
In this challenge, the student created an interactive map to vizualize earthquake data and the tectonic plaques.

## Deliverables
An interactive map was created with the layers below:

### Data layer: you can apply only one or a combination of all layers below
* Earthquake data from the last 7 days

* Major earthquakes from last 7 days

* Tectonic plaques (show the relationship between the earthquakes and the tectonic plates' limits)
